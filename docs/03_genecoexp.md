# Creating gene co-expression networks
With the trimmed expression matrix obtained from the [previous tutorial](02_qc.md), we are now ready to create gene co-expression networks based on our gene of interest. For this example, we will use the amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene (lcl|PKPP01004763.1_cds_PWA62882.1_36881) from <i>Artemisia annua</i> as our gene of interest. 

## Running the script
  * Enter the directory where you want your co-expression networks to be generated
  * Run the [LSTrAP-Lite_PCC_cal.py](../LSTrAP-Lite_PCC_cal.py) script

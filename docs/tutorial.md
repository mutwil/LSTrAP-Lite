# Tutorial
Welcome to the tutorial on how to use the LSTrAP-Lite source code!
We will use the sample data provided to demonstrate how to modify the code to build your own co-expression networks.

## Modifying the paths

![paths](./images/paths.png "Paths to edit")

In the section "Paths to edit" found in LSTrAP-Lite_download.py, there are a few paths that needs to be modified for the script to work.
  * <b>pathtolocal</b> refers to the directory that your will be working in to download and process the files.
  * <b>download_list</b> refers to the file that contains the SRA run ID and the respective library format of the files that you want to download. Click [here](/sample_data/sra_runID.txt) for an example.

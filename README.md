# What is LSTrAP-Lite?
LSTrAP-Lite is a pipeline designed for building co-expression networks from RNA-seq data (fastq files from <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">ENA</a>) on a lightweight, linux based device, such as the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/rock64/">Rock64</a>. 

Below, you can find the tutorial on how to build your own co-expression networks with the source code and example data provided. An advanced tutorial on how to annotate the co-expression neighbourhood using mercator is also available.
